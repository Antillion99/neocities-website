                        <p>As a Council Republic, the Veikan Government is composed of a hierarchy of
                            decentralized assemblies going from the lower local levels to higher supreme ones. The
                            country is divided in local, city, regional and national councils each having a level of autonomy
                            and control on their assigned working areas. Members of the party selected by their local
                            communities are elected in a 5 year basis for positions in their assigned local council,
                            members of said local council can be elected by their city council for positions within it and so
                            on.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Congress of Councils is the top council in the Republic, with its members
                            elected by the provincial councils underneath it and holding authority over the matters of
                            law and government of the state. It is the crowning jewel of Veikan Socialist Democracy, and the
                            driving force of Ignatovism both in the nation and abroad.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Ignatovist Council System allows true democracy for the working
                                people.</strong></p>

                        <p>The construction of the Congress of Councils started in 1982 in the capital city of Oztov to replace 
                            the old Imperial House of Lords that had been repurposed as the Congress after the Civil War. It now houses
                            over 120 Councilmen who work to maintain the law and stability of the Ignatovist Socialist Democracy.</p>

                        <p>Members of the Congress are elected every 5 years by the many Provincial Councils of the nation.</p>
