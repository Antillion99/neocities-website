                <p>Think of this as a blog, except very short. Here I will post random thoughts I thought might be interesting
                for others to read or just random brain juice leakages I might have. I might also post site updates here if necessary
                who knows, this is just <i>T H E W O R D Z O N E</i>.</p>

                <p><b>[09/07/2020] 12:45 AM GMT</b> - I've started to sit down and actually learn Javascript more "traditionally". My
                knowledge is there, it's just kind of all over the place because I haven't "ordered" it inside my brain. Paid 12 bucks
                for a course on Udemy as a starter, hopefully I wasn't ripped off and I learn something out of this.</p>
                <p><b>[06/07/2020] 12:23 PM GMT</b> - Finally, the Word Zone is in working order, the place where I just write things 
                nobody cares about in a very short format. The website is almost finished at the time of writing and I had a bit of a 
                pain as usual making the website work decently enough on mobile. Hopefully, the rest can be finished soon.</p>
