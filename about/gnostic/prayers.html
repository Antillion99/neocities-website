            <p class="prayer">I acknowledge one great invisible God,<br/>
            unrevealable, unmarked, ageless and unproclaimable;<br/>
            the unknown Father, the Aeon of the aeons,<br/>
            who brought forth in the silence with his Providence:<br/>
            the Father, the Mother, and the Son.</p>
    
            <p class="prayer">I acknowledge the Christos, the self-begotten living Son,<br/>
            the glory of the Father and the virtue of the Mother,<br/>
            who given birth from the virginal and ineffable Mother,<br/>
            was made incarnate, the Perfect one.<br/>
            Who in the word of the Great Invisible God,<br/>
            came down from above to annul the emptiness of this age<br/>
            and restore the fullness to the Aeon.</p>
    
            <p class="prayer">I acknowledge the Holy Spirit, the Bride of the Christos,<br/>
            the Mother of the Aeons, the great virginal and ineffable Mother<br/>
            Who proceeded from Herself a gift of Herself<br/>
            out of the silence of the Unknown God.</p>
    
            <p class="prayer">I acknowledge the Light of the one church in every place:<br/>
            Interior, Invisible, Secret and Universal,<br/>
            the foundation of the lights of the great living God.<br/>
            I seek liberation of my perfection<br/>
            from the corruptions of the world<br/>
            and look to the gathering of the sparks of Light<br/>
            from the sea of forgetfulness.</p>
            <strong>Amen.</strong>

                Let us not fall into temptation: defend us from all danger and evil:<br/>
                Let Thy mighty power ever guard and protect us.<br/>
