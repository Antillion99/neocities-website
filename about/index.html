                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>My name is ███████ ███████, I'm a 20 year old from Argentina (CABA) and known
                online as <b>Antillion</b> and my pronouns are <b>He/Him</b> or <b>They/Them</b>. Most of my interests generally 
                revolve around computers and related technologies. They include, but are not limited to, the 
                following topics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming & Software Development (Still junior level, but planning to learn more) </li>
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <li>Game Development</li>
                    <li>Linux (Current OS is Debian, God bless!)</li>
                    <li>Theology and Dualism</li>
                    <li class="crossed">Getting a job. Please help.</li>
                    <li>Virtual machines and old Operating Systems</li>
                    <li>Worldbuilding and creative writting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I'm a native Spanish speaker and I consider myself pretty fluent in English, being able to maintain a 
                conversation with native English speakers just fine, chat in English, watch videos in English, all that stuff.</p>

                <p>I can code in HTML/CSS and JS (This site was made entirely from scratch by me). I also have some experience in Python,
                Lua, and C#. I'm pretty good at using Linux considering I use it daily as my main OS. I've used Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, and Arch
                in the past but ultimately I always come back to my baby Debian. I'd say I'm resourceful enough to search how to fix or do things
                I don't know how to do. I like to keep things simple but I'm not an extremist, sometimes it's worth it to sacrifice simplicity for ease
                of use or just not looking bad.</p>

                <p>When it comes to other areas I have an interest in theology, dualism, and religion. I consider myself a Gnostic but I'm not
                necessarily actively religious or "evangelizing", it's just an interest of mine I'm not interested in shoving down others' throats. I
                have always had an interest in the occult and 'dark' from a purely aesthetic perspective. I'm not goth, or interested in deep esotericism
                or witchcraft beyond a surface interest in their style and presentation. <b>Weird new age cults please don't message me.</b></p>
                
                <p>More "minor" interests of mine are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding">worldbuilding</a> and messing around with old
                operating systems like Windows 9X or old Macintosh.</p>
